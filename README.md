# clinical_sl_ecg
This repository implements deep learning model trained on two datasets of 12-leads clinical ECG and tested on smart device AliveCor single lead ECG. The proposed model for test-set is given below:

1. Fig (a) implements a simple model, aim to identify the issues related to deep learning model distribution issue when it comes to 12-leads clinical vs smart device single lead ECG.
2. Fig (b) introduced three additional layers to overcome the issues found previously for performance enhancement.
